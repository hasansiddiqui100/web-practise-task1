                    Education and the provincial governments, while the federal government mostly assists in curriculum
                    development, accreditation and the financing of research and development. Article 25-A of the
                    Constitution of Pakistan obligates the state to provide free and compulsory quality education to
                    children of the age group 5 to 16 years. "The State shall provide free and compulsory education to
                    all children of the age of five to sixteen years in such a manner as may be determined by law".</p>

                <p class="section-Subtag text-small">The education system in Pakistan[4] is generally divided into six
                    levels: preschool (for the age from 3 to 5 years), primary (years one to five), middle (years six to
                    eight), secondary (years nine and ten, leading to the Secondary School Certificate or SSC),
                    intermediate (years eleven and twelve, leading to a Higher Secondary School Certificate or HSSC),
                    and university programs leading to undergraduate and graduate degrees.[5] The Higher Education
                    Commission established in 2002 is responsible for all universities and degree awarding
                    institutes.[6] It was established in 2002 with Atta-ur-Rahman as its Founding Chairman.</p>

                <p class="section-Subtag text-small">Pakistan still has a low literacy rate relative to other
                    countries.[8] As of 2022 Pakistan's literacy rates range from 96% in Islamabad to 23% in the Torghar
                    District.[9] Literacy rates vary by gender and region. In tribal areas female literacy is 9.5%,[10]
                    while Azad Kashmir has a literacy rate of 91%.[11] Pakistan's population of children not in school
                    (22.8 million children) is the second largest in the world after Nigeria.[12] According to the data,
                    Pakistan faces a significant unemployment challenge, particularly among its educated youth, with
                    over 31% of them being unemployed. Moreover, women account for 51% of the overall unemployed
                    population, highlighting a gender disparity in employment opportunities.[13] Pakistan produces about
                    445,000 university graduates and 25,000 to 30,000 computer science graduates per year As of 2021</p>
