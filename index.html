                <p class="section-Subtag text-small">n Pakistan, mobile phones have become a critical tool for both 
                    communication and business, especially as the country continues to see a digital transformation. 
                    The proliferation of smartphones, particularly affordable models, has significantly increased internet 
                    penetration and social media engagement. Mobile phones are now integral for online shopping, digital 
                    payments, and accessing essential services such as education, healthcare, and government portals. 
                    The rise of local and international mobile brands has created a competitive market, with consumers 
                    benefiting from a diverse range of choices in terms of specifications, design, and pricing.</p>

                <p class="section-Subtag text-small">Mobile phones have become an essential part of daily life in Pakistan, 
                    connecting people across cities and rural areas. With the rapid expansion of 4G and now the introduction 
                    of 5G trials, smartphone usage has significantly increased. Brands like Samsung, Apple, Vivo, Oppo, and 
                    local companies like QMobile offer a wide range of options, catering to different budget segments. Affordable
                    internet packages from telecom providers such as Jazz, Zong, Telenor, and Ufone have further boosted digital 
                    communication, social media usage, and online businesses. </p>

                <p class="section-Subtag text-small">QMobile was once one of the leading mobile phone brands in Pakistan, known
                    for offering affordable feature phones and smartphones. Launched in 2009, the brand quickly gained popularity
                    due to its budget-friendly prices and wide range of models catering to the masses. QMobile competed with 
                    international brands by providing stylish designs, large displays, and decent specifications at low costs. 
                    It played a key role in making smartphones accessible to a larger audience in Pakistan. However, with the rise
                    of Chinese brands like Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi, QMobile's market presence declined significantly.</p>
